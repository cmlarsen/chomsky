# Add Participants
---
The Starter Kit includes two example Participants as demonstrations. Launch NoamInputDemo and NoamOutputDemo. 

>What should the demo Participant Apps be? Ideastorm:
> iOS app that outputs IMU values + Processing App that orients a shape to mimic. 
> Processing App with Color Picker + Processing App with a colored box.

>Ideally these would be on different devices on the network e.g. mobile or tablet or another PC. They would ideally be of two different dialects. The demo would possibly form the base for additional experimentation. The demo would showcase multiple topics with different message types.

The demonstration Lemmas will automatically connect to the Noam Moderator, generate Topics X,Y,and Z, and begin sending messages.

Now that you have your Noam Moderator running, you can add [Lemmas](/docs/Lemmas.htm) to your own Participants and start building your prototype.
