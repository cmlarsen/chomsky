The Noam interface can be loaded on your machine at any time by going to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Name your Noam
Noam defaults to using your Mac's networkID for a name. You'll be entering this a lot when writing code, so enter a unique (and easy to type) Name for your Moderator under Settings. 
![Naming your Noam Server](/img/servernaming.png)

Your Noam Moderator needs a unique name so that Lemmas connect to your server as intended. If two Noam Moderators on the same network share the same name, Lemma connection can be unpredictable as it will be based upon which moderator the lemma hears from first.

Congratulations, your Noam Moderator is ready to hosts conversations in your room, now itâ€™s time to add Participants.
